# Multi-purpose NFT Draft Spec

## Overview

This m-NFT proposal covers the following functionalities.

- Publicity of the issuer information for authentication purpose
- *Class* definition for multiple NFT items with the same attribute
- *Limited number* definition for pre-defined issuance count
- *Set* definition for a suit of collectibles across different classes
- *Claim* action supported for ticket like scenarios
- Exchangablility, permenent lock, and self destructibility enable bits configuration
- Inscript by holders
- Extensible information definition

The basic m-NFT issurance logic is to create an `Issuer Cell` first, which defines the issuer’s basic information. And then to create a `NFT Class Cell` with it, which consistes of the specific information for a class of NFT items. With the `NFT Class Cell`, one could issue `NFT Cell` to the users.

## Issuer Cell

### Data structure

```
Data:
	version: uint8
	class_count: uint32
	set_count: uint32
	info_size: uint16
	info: infomation in json format
Type:
	code_hash: ISSUER_TYPE
	args: type_id
Lock:
	--
```

`version` field is set to 0 for now, which indicates the data format version of this cell.

`class_count` field records the created class count for the issuer, which should be set to zero at creation, and auto increase when create new `NFT Class Cells`.

`set_count` is almost the same as `class_count`, only it is used for `set` creation count.

`info` field is assumed to record the issuer’s public information, such as SNS account, images, etc. And the `info_size` field should be set to the byte length of `info`.

The `typescript` of Issuer Cell is set to `ISSUER_TYPE` with args equals to `type_id`, where `type_id` follows the same [rules of `Type ID` script 1](https://xuejie.space/2020_02_03_introduction_to_ckb_script_programming_type_id/).

Here we define the `IssuerID = issuer_cell_typescript_hash[:20]` for the future usage.

To make the `info` field more compatible across different front-end services, here we give some suggested varible keys:

- `name`: issuer’s name in UTF-8 encoding
- `website`: issuer’s website URL
- `email`: email address
- `authentication`: typically an SNS announcement about the issuance
- `image`: image URL for issuer

## NFT Class Cell

Every NFT Class Cell stands for a group of specific NFT itmes with the same properties. And different NFT Cells issued by the same NFT Class Cell will be marked with different `TokenID` as its identity.

### Data Structure

```
Data:
	// must
	version: uint8
	total: uint32
	issued: uint32
	<<property: uint64>> // replaced by nft_cell.characteristic
	configure: uint8
	name: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	description: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	renderer: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	// optional data array
	extinfo_data: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	extinfo_data: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	...
Type:
	code_hash: NFT_CLASS_TYPE
	args:  <IssuerID:byte20> | <class_id:uint32>
Lock:
	--
```

Where `typescript.args` equals to `IssuerID` join `class_id`, and the `class_id` is an auto-increment variable according to the `class_count` variable in the Issuer Cell.

`total` means the issurance number limitation, zero for unlimited.

`issued` means the item number that already issued for this class, it’s also used for the NFT Cell `TokenID` variable, equals to zero when initally created.

`property` is a user defined variable to set up the NFT characteristics, we could consider it as the DNA of the items. (It’s removed, and replaced by `characteristic` field in the NFT Cell with the same functionality.)

`configure` is a bitmap variable to constrain the behavior of the NFT items issued by this Class. The bitmap meaning table follows (the bit 0 or 1 means specific functionality enabled or disable).

| bit index | meaning                   | notes                                        |
| :-------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| bit 0     | claimable                 |                                              |
| bit 1     | lockability               | permanent locked permit                      |
| bit 2     | inscription               | NFT holder could append inscript to the cell |
| bit 3     | reserved                  |                                              |
| bit 4     | exchangable before claim  |                                              |
| bit 5     | exchangable after claim   |                                              |
| bit 6     | destructible before claim |                                              |
| bit 7     | destructible after claim  |                                              |

`name`, `description`, and `renderer` are static informational fields for the tokens. But the front-end dApps could pass some specific data to the `renderer` URL, such as `property` to get runtime generated rich media data.

The RFC also allows user defined `extinfo_data` array to provide more information.

### Creation Transaction

The `Issuer Cell` must be present at the input side of the transaction, and the NFT Class Cell could be batch created.

```
INPUT:
Issuer_cell:
	Data:
		class_count: k
	Type:
		code_hash: ISSUER_TYPE
		args: type_id
OUTPUT:
	Issuer_cell:
		Data:
			class_count: k + m
		Type:
			code_hash: ISSUER_TYPE
			args: type_id
	NFT_class_cell:
		Data:
			total: N_1
			issued: 0
		Type:
			code_hash: NFT_CLASS_TYPE
			args: IssuerID | <class_id = k>
	...
	NFT_class_cell:
		Data:
			total: N_m
			issued: 0
		Type:
			code_hash: NFT_CLASS_TYPE
			args: IssuerID | <class_id = k+m-1>
```

## NFT Cell

NFT Cell is issued by NFT Class Cell, with the same `configure` and different `TokenID` and `state` field.

### Data Structure

```
Data:
	// must
	version: uint8
	characteristic: byte[8]
	configure: uint8
	state: uint8 
	// optional
	extinfo_data: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	...
Type:
	code_hash: NFT_TYPE
	args: IssuerID | class_id | TokenID
Lock:
	--
```

`configure` must be the same as `nft_class_cell.configure`. And `state` is different for different NFT Cell, which is used for indication of current NFT state.

| bit index | meaning     | note                       |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------------- |
| bit 0     | claim state | 0/1 => unclaimed / claimed |
| bit 1     | lock state  | 0/1 => free / locked       |
| other     | reserved    | –                          |

`typescript.args.IssuerID | class_id` must be the same as that of `nft_class_cell`, and the `TokenID` field must be the issued index of `nft_class_cell.issued` field.

### Issuance Transaction

The typescript allows batch issuance of the NFT Cells.

```
INPUT:
	NFT_class_cell:
		Data:
			total: N
			issued: < k >
			property: P
			configure: C
		Type:
			code_hash: NFT_CLASS_TYPE
			args: IssuerID | class_id
OUTPUT:
	NFT_class_cell:
		Data:
			total: N
			issued: < k + m <= N >
			property: P
			configure: C
		Type:
			code_hash: NFT_CLASS_TYPE
			args: IssuerID | class_id
	NFT_cell:
		Data:
			configure: C
			state: 0 
		Type:
			code_hash: NFT_TYPE
			args: IssuerID | class_id | <TokenID = k>
	...
	NFT_cell:
		Data:
			configure: C
			state: 0 
			...
		Type:
			code_hash: NFT_TYPE
			args: IssuerID | class_id | <TokenID = k+m-1>
```

## NFT Set Cell

The issuer could create NFT Set Cell to define a suit of collectible of NFT Classes.

### Data Structure

```
Data:
	// must
	version: uint8
	set_id: uint32
	set_name: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	set_description: <size:uint16 + <vartext>
	item_list_size: uint16
	item_list: <class_id:uint32> * item_list_size
	// optional
	extinfo_data: <size:uint16> + <vartext>
	...
Type:
	code_hash: NFT_SET_TYPE
	args: IssuerID
```
