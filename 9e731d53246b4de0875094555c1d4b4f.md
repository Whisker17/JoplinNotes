- 上周我们的公众号由于一位社区成员的推广增加了接近70名成员，他是一名专注于各个项目的空投的专业人士，他有自己的社群，但是由于上周我们的Gleam已经停止注册，导致这部分新加入的社区成员无法参与到最后的空投，他们希望知道是否意味着在此之后他们将永久失去空投的机会。（我的想法是，即使他们没有注册Gleam，他们获得的ZBP也可以通过和别的有空投资格的人进行交易来获取价值）

  Last week, our official account increased by nearly 70 members due to the promotion of a community member. He is a professional who focuses on airdrops of various projects. He has his own community, but since last week our Gleam has been stopped. By registering, these new community members cannot participate in the final airdrop. They want to know whether it means that they will permanently lose the opportunity to airdrop after this. (My idea is that even if they don’t register for Gleam, the ZBP they get can be valued by trading with other people who are available to invest.)

- 同时由于Gleam的停止注册，我们该如何去吸引更多的新社区成员，即使有ZBP的激励，无法参与最终的空投意味着这部分ZBP是没有价值的。

  At the same time, due to the suspension of Gleam registration, how can we attract more new community members? Even with the incentive of ZBP, the inability to participate in the final airdrop means that this part of ZBP is worthless.

- 上周中文社区开启了一个节点激励活动，部署节点持续在线的用户可以每天获得1ZBP，本次活动将持续一个月左右，我们的节点数量在 Telemetry 上名列前茅，非常高兴我们中文社区也贡献了将近50个节点，由于我们之前的 Telemetry 到达了硬顶，是否有方法可以知道我们的节点准确数量？

  Last week, the Chinese community launched a node incentive activity. Users who deploy nodes continuously online can get 1 ZBP every day. This activity will last about a month. Our number of nodes is among the best on Telemetry. I am very happy that our Chinese community has also contributed nearly 40 Since our previous Telemetry reached the hard cap, is there a way to know the exact number of our nodes?

- 后续的社区安排，在主网上线前我们还需要如何去吸引新的社区成员

  Follow-up community arrangements, do we need to attract new community members before the mainnet goes live?

- 接下来的两周，我会去接触一些中国区块链社区和团队，进行推广
