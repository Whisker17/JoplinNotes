- ## LMSR

  When a person trades in blockchain, they don't do a peer-2-peer trade but a "peer-2-contract" trade. So a person trades against an entity that is in charge of "creating" a market for that person, this is an Automated Market Maker. So this person trades against an algorithm that tries to give him the best deal as possible, and the second tries to lose the less amount of money that it can (or winning money) by doing this. And, the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) is a way to program an AMM

  Q: Thanks for the explanation. I have some questions, maybe you can answer them here. Otherwise we can talk about it another time via voice. 

  1.  Is a market created for exactly one trade or does it persist? 
  2.  Who is "the second"? Do you mean the other participant in the trade? 
  3.  Is this model limited to 1 offerer 1 taker or is it another mapping, like 1-M or N-M?
  4.  Do you see parallels between prediction markets and AMM+LMSR? 
  5. Can AMM+LMSR technically be used for a prediction market and if yes, what advantage does it have?

  A: 1) with this you have a trade-off. Establishing a particular cost for a particular trade tends to be very expensive in terms of computational cost (giving the fact that a desirable characteristic for the market is that it has liquidity, that implies more transactions as well). Nevertheless, some models make the calculations based on the sum of the prices and the probability of this particular price (and other features). In that way, you limit the analysis to that particular distribution of prices, and you can change it with certain criteria (signals, time, etc). But the ideal is to make it the more individual as possible. 2) With the second I was referring to the algorithm (sorry about the bad expression). 3) If I understand this question correctly, number one may answer it. 4) For the case of prediction markets, Market scoring rules are used to, for example, compute the current price of a stock in a prediction market
