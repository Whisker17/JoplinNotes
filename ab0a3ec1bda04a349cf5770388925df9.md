He is a professional who focuses on airdrops of various projects. He has his own community, but since last week our Gleam has been stopped. By registering, these new community members cannot participate in the final airdrop. They want to know whether it means that they will permanently lose the opportunity to airdrop after this. (My idea is that even if they don%E2%80%99t register for Gleam, the ZBP they get can be valued by trading with other people who are available to invest.)%0A%0A- %E5%90%8C%E6%97%B6%E7%94%B1%E4%BA%8EGleam%E7%9A%84%E5%81%9C%E6%AD%A2%E6%B3%A8%E5%86%8C%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E8%AF%A5%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%8E%BB%E5%90%B8%E5%BC%95%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%9A%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B0%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E6%88%90%E5%91%98%EF%BC%8C%E5%8D%B3%E4%BD%BF%E6%9C%89ZBP%E7%9A%84%E6%BF%80%E5%8A%B1%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%A0%E6%B3%95%E5%8F%82%E4%B8%8E%E6%9C%80%E7%BB%88%E7%9A%84%E7%A9%BA%E6%8A%95%E6%84%8F%E5%91%B3%E7%9D%80%E8%BF%99%E9%83%A8%E5%88%86ZBP%E6%98%AF%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E4%BB%B7%E5%80%BC%E7%9A%84%E3%80%82%0A%0A  At the same time, due to the suspension of Gleam registration, how can we attract more new community members? Even with the incentive of ZBP, the inability to participate in the final airdrop means that this part of ZBP is worthless.%0A%0A- %E4%B8%8A%E5%91%A8%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E5%BC%80%E5%90%AF%E4%BA%86%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E6%BF%80%E5%8A%B1%E6%B4%BB%E5%8A%A8%EF%BC%8C%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E6%8C%81%E7%BB%AD%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF%E7%9A%84%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E6%AF%8F%E5%A4%A9%E8%8E%B7%E5%BE%971ZBP%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%AC%E6%AC%A1%E6%B4%BB%E5%8A%A8%E5%B0%86%E6%8C%81%E7%BB%AD%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E6%9C%88%E5%B7%A6%E5%8F%B3%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E6%95%B0%E9%87%8F%E5%9C%A8 Telemetry %E4%B8%8A%E5%90%8D%E5%88%97%E5%89%8D%E8%8C%85%EF%BC%8C%E9%9D%9E%E5%B8%B8%E9%AB%98%E5%85%B4%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E4%B9%9F%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE%E4%BA%86%E5%B0%86%E8%BF%9150%E4%B8%AA%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%EF%BC%8C%E7%94%B1%E4%BA%8E%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E4%B9%8B%E5%89%8D%E7%9A%84 Telemetry %E5%88%B0%E8%BE%BE%E4%BA%86%E7%A1%AC%E9%A1%B6%EF%BC%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%90%A6%E6%9C%89%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E7%9A%84%E8%8A%82%E7%82%B9%E5%87%86%E7%A1%AE%E6%95%B0%E9%87%8F%EF%BC%9F%0A%0A  Last week, the Chinese community launched a node incentive activity. Users who deploy nodes continuously online can get 1 ZBP every day. This activity will last about a month. Our number of nodes is among the best on Telemetry. I am very happy that our Chinese community has also contributed nearly 40 Since our previous Telemetry reached the hard cap, is there a way to know the exact number of our nodes?%0A%0A- %E5%90%8E%E7%BB%AD%E7%9A%84%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E5%AE%89%E6%8E%92%EF%BC%8C%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%BB%E7%BD%91%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF%E5%89%8D%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E8%BF%98%E9%9C%80%E8%A6%81%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%8E%BB%E5%90%B8%E5%BC%95%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E6%88%90%E5%91%98%0A%0A  Follow-up community arrangements, do we need to attract new community members before the mainnet goes live?%0A\\n %0A- %E6%8E%A5\\n@@ -1810,8 +1810,10 @@\\n %E5%92%8C%E5%9B%A2%E9%98%9F%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E6%8E%A8%E5%B9%BF\\n+%0A%0A\\n"
