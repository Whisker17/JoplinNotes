## My Thought

- Chinese people almost characterize Pm as gambling, I still try to reverse their minds, but not work well. I also read a lot of post about PM, trying to sum up PM's difference with gambling, do you have a good idea?
- Chinese people seems not interested in programs those still not IDO, because they can not value their tokens in hand. Also I can't value our token, from the perspective of circulation, comparing with Augur, maybe 1ZTG equals $1? What about ZBP?
- I will talk to Yin Cao or some other kols, if some Chinese teams contact with you, maybe I can help with something, just let me have a chance to communicate with them.
- Maybe our research can have some posts, just let me know our program's unique point. I have say futarchy and lmsr many times (I just try to learn more about lmsr, like [this](https://bitcoinhivemind.com/papers/))
