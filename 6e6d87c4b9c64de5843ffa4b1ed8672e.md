# General Interview

## Introduce yourself

我是一名来自中国的开源爱好者，在 2017 年接触到了区块链行业，而在 2018 年成为了一名区块链的后端开发人员，主要进行的工作是钱包交易所的后端支持以及公司的公链项目中的隐私模块和跨链交易设计与开发。而在同一年我加入了中国最大的 Ethereum 社区之一——EthFans ，在其中担任了一名兼职翻译，为 Ethereum 在中国的发展和推广尽了自己的一份力，之后我也参与了别的区块链社区，包括 Nervos 以及一些中国的区块链开源社区，翻译了一些文章，也参与到了很多 Meetup 的活动中。在 2020 年我意识到自己无法兼顾开发人员以及社区参与者两个角色，于是选择辞去自己开发人员的工作，从而去深度了解区块链整个行业。而 2020 年也是 DeFi 爆发的一年，所以我也参与了一些 DeFi 的活动，也为自己的原公司调研了当时 Dex 的现状，并协助一起设计了适合其公链的Dex。

Hi,I am Whisker, an open source enthusiast from China. I came into contact with the blockchain industry in 2017 and became a blockchain back-end developer in 2018. My main work is the back-end support of wallet and exchange as well as the design and development of privacy module and cross-chain transaction with Ethereum in the company's public chain project (https://github.com/33cn/chain33). And in the same year, I joined one of the largest Ethereum communities in China - [EthFans](https://ethfans.org/), where I served as a part-time translator and contributed to the development and promotion of Ethereum in China. After that, I also participated in other blockchain community, including Nervos and some Chinese blockchain open source communities, have translated some articles and participated in many Meetup activities. In 2020, I realized that I couldn't take into account the two roles of developer and community participant, so I chose to quit my job as a developer to gain a deep understanding of the entire blockchain industry. And 2020 is also the year when DeFi broke out, so I also participated in some DeFi activities, and I also investigated the current situation of Dex for my original company at that time, and assisted in designing a Dex suitable for its public chain.

## Introduce your previous work

作为一名区块链后端开发人员，主力开发语言为 Golang 。早期我负责为公司的钱包和交易所项目进行区块链相关的后端支持，之后参与到公司的公链项目，由于公司的区块链注重可插拔，所以大多数功能是通过合约作为插件来实现的。在这段时间我参与了公司闪电网络、隐私以及与 Ethereum 的跨链交易的相关开发。本人根据之前的工作维护了两个 awesome 类型的项目：[Layer2Things](https://github.com/Whisker17/Layer2Things) 和 [zkpThings](https://github.com/Whisker17/zkpThings/blob/dev/Awesome_Resources.md) 。而作为 EthFans 的兼职翻译，翻译了十余篇 Ethereum 相关的文章，帮助 EthFans 发展成为中国最大的 Ethereum 社区之一。之后参与了 Nervos 、DODO、OpenSea 的开源社区，同样进行了一系列翻译工作。

As a blockchain back-end developer, my main development language is Golang. In the early stage, I was responsible for the back-end support related to blockchain for the company's wallet and exchange projects. Later, I participated in the company's public chain project. Since the company's blockchain focuses on pluggable, most functions are realized through contracts as plug-ins. During this time I was involved in the development of the company's lightning network, privacy, and cross-chain transactions with Ethereum,etc. I have maintained two awesome projects based on my previous work:
[Layer2Things](https://github.com/Whisker17/Layer2Things) and[zkpThings](https://github.com/Whisker17/zkpThings/blob/dev/Awesome_Resources.md).
As a part-time translator for Ethfans, I have translated more than ten articles related to Ethereum, helping Ethfans develop into one of the largest Ethereum communities in China.
Later, I participated in the open source communities of Nervos, Dodo and OpenSea, and also carried out a series of translation work.
