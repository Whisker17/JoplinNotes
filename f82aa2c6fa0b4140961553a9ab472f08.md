## Ask faucet for testnet token

- If you want to participate in this Derby, you have to get our testnet token first.

- Join in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xv8HuA4s8v) and choose faucet like this.

- Send a message like this `!drip 5Hxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 100` to get your testnet token for you account. On this command line, `5Hxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` represents your Polkadot address and `100` represents the quantity of testnet token you need.

  ![buy & sell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Whisker17/ImageStoreService/main/20210506191144.png)

- If you want to **BUY** , just click `BUY` button and fill in the amount. The upper one means how many ZTG you want to bet on, and the lower one means how many **SHARES** you want to bet on. For example, if you want to bet 10 ZTG, because of the `Price` is 0.1422, you can get 10/0.1422=70.32 SHARES (without considering the **Fee**). Similarly, if you want to bet 10 SHARES, you need to pay 1.422 ZTG.
