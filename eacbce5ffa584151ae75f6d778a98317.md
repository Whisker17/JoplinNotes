- 1) When the market starts, we have no past EMA information for the asset. If we use short periods, we will have a high dispersion in the consecutive EMA_t / EMA_t+k ratios. This would effectively lead to a high volatility in trading fees during the first time, until EMA stabilises. Assuming what I wrote is correct: Do we want to use LS LSMR for the first period and then switch to LSD LSMR once we have enough data , do we just use LSD LSMR all the time and use the static fee  f until enough data is gathered, or is it something completely different?
- 2) The dynamic and analogous nature of fee adjustment might bring some difficulties in an decentralised blockchain-based market place: The state is updated approximately every 6 seconds. Every user does see the old state of the system and trade based on the "old" state. For instace: for assets x,y,z we have the amounts [ax, ay, az], prices [pxy, pxz, pyz] and fees [fxy, fxz, fyz]. Every trader trades on those simultaneously, they send a transaction that covers their action which is included in an unspecified order with the other transactions in at least the next state update, at higher loads even later state updates. So it could be that "at the same time" (meaning having the same old information), thousands of traders trade x for y for price pxy and fxy, then at one point those trade are collected in a block and evaluated. If the fee update is dynamically calculated after every transaction, it might occur that the unlucky traders whose order was processed last have to pay horrendous fees. Is my assumption correct that within a couple of trades, if they lead to a "shock" situation, the fees can be adjusted extremely? Is this mitigated by higher EMA periods and if yes, how would this affect the revenue of the DMM and LPs? In case this is true, we could implement a accepted fee range for the traders and when the fee rises too much, the order will be cancelled instead of executed. But due to the nature of PoS and block authoring, this could lead to traders paying block authors for good execution positions of their orders.


- Yes, for this cases we'll have that the total fee is equals to the initial fee (the fixed one), because the r parameter will be 1, and into the equation we have a (r-n) term, and n by default is 1
- Yes, so this is an interesting point. Speaking of demand pumps on the assets I think that we have 2 types: shocks and structure changes. Shocks are occasional high volume transactions that occurs for X reason, and they can be considered as an isolated case (imagine Elon Musk tweeting about pumping DOGE). Structure changes, on the other hand, are changes that occur suddenly, but this trend is maintained over time (imagine that we have a market of 2 possible outcomes related to the result of a presidential election an suddenly a video of a candidate that objectively injures it's image comes in). The benefits of the EMA are that, for the first case, future traders will not be charged too much for a larger period, because this "shock" is smoothed with the previous observations. On the other hand, changes of structure will imply a notorious volume change, that'll translate into notorious fee increases at the beginning, and when the slope reduces, the fee will do that as well
