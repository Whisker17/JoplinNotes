- Chinese AMA

  Since Anson and I have an idea for an AMA, the time will probably be around the end of May. I need to confirm something about the Chinese Community AMA. I noticed that we once held an AMA on Telegram in February, which was very successful. I also translated the whole process, and I will publish it on WeChat official account in these two days, and then promote it in the Chinese community.

  Anson and I think we need a **poster** for this AMA, as well as an incentive to participate in this activity. I see that the AMA before will set up the best question and then award 50 dollars. Can we also set it like this? They then run a poll to choose the top five issues, which makes it more decentralized. 

  Who do I need to communicate with about the poster? james

  Where would we hold this activity? prefer Telegram

  

- wechat official account

  Let me explain why the WeChat official account has not been established yet.  The reason is that the WeChat official account needs to be bound with an ID card when registering, and each identity The ID card can only be bound to one WeChat official account. When I tried to register for the WeChat official account last Wednesday, I found out that there was such a restriction, so I cancelled my official account that was bound to my ID card, and the official WeChat account needed a week Time to allow registration of the next official account, so if it goes well, it can be constructed this Wednesday

  I will also build a summary of Chinese community social media

- activity

  Because many community members are more concerned about our later activities. For example, today I announced the cooperation with Rmrk. Many people will ask for the specific time. I want to confirm the activities including derby. We will hold it on the testnet in the follow-up. derby's activity first, right? And when would the testnet launch?

- Chinese name

  Anson also thinks that we may need a Chinese name for a project, but in fact, I saw that most projects with Chinese names are transliterated, and Zeitgeist doesn’t seem to have any transliterated names, and most projects don’t have Chinese names. So I want to ask if everyone feels it is necessary to do this
