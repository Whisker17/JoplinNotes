In the early stage, I was responsible for the back-end support related to blockchain for the company's wallet and exchange projects. Later, I participated in the company's public chain project. Since the company's blockchain focuses on pluggable, most functions are realized through contracts as plug-ins. During this time I was involved in the development of the company's lightning network, privacy, and cross-chain transactions with Ethereum,etc. I have maintained two awesome projects based on my previous work:%0D%0A%5BLayer2Things%5D(https://github.com/Whisker17/Layer2Things) and%5BzkpThings%5D(https://github.com/Whisker17/zkpThings/blob/dev/Awesome_Resources.md).%0D%0AAs a part-time translator for Ethfans, I have translated more than ten articles related to Ethereum, helping Ethfans develop into one of the largest Ethereum communities in China.%0D%0ALater, I participated in the open source communities of Nervos, Dodo and OpenSea, and also carried out a series of translation work.\\n"
