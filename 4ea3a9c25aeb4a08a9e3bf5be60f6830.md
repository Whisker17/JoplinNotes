I came into contact with the blockchain industry in 2017 and became a blockchain back-end developer in 2018. My main work is the back-end support of wallet and exchange as well as the design and development of privacy module and cross-chain transaction with Ethereum in the company's public chain project (https://github.com/33cn/chain33). And in the same year, I joined one of the largest Ethereum communities in China - EtherFans, where I served as a part-time translator and contributed to the development and promotion of Ethereum in China. After that, I also participated in other blockchain community, including Nervos and some Chinese blockchain open source communities, have translated some articles and participated in many Meetup activities. In 2020, I realized that I couldn't take into account the two roles of developer and community participant, so I chose to quit my job as a developer to gain a deep understanding of the entire blockchain industry. And 2020 is also the year when DeFi broke out, so I also participated in some DeFi activities, and I also investigated the current situation of Dex for my original company at that time, and assisted in designing a Dex suitable for its public chain.\\n"
