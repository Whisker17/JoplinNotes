## What is Prediction Market？

The prediction market is a speculative market that allows traders to establish positions on possible future outcomes. 

The prediction market is a wonderful thought experiment. If anyone can bet money on any event, the society will be able to make better use of the hidden information and knowledge. 

Furthermore, it can even use the prediction market to change the outcome of the event to the specific direction. 

The prediction market can also predict the future, hedge the risk of possible future events, and provide incentives for the future due to the correlation of interests. 

The relationship between the prediction market and reality is two-way. Reality can affect the market. Similarly, we can also output high-quality information for reality through the game of the market. Eventually, the prediction market can become a tool to collect world information and make better predictions. .

## What is Futarchy？

## What is the deference between CPM and DPM？

Compared with traditional centralized prediction markets, decentralized prediction markets relying on cryptocurrencies can be 

- **open** (usually, traditional prediction markets are limited to the countries/regions where they were created. But for cryptocurrencies , It is difficult to limit it.),
- **less restrictions** (many of today’s most popular prediction markets have restrictions. For example, if users win in many markets, they are no longer allowed to bet.) ,
- **Lower fees** (in most cases, the cost of a centralized market is higher than that of Ethereum) 
- **cannot be closed by one party** (the centralized prediction market has a history of being closed).

## What is the deference between prediction market and betting?

Fair, open and transparent blockchain technology can ensure the fairness and justice of the prediction market, and the handling fee is extremely low. This is the difference between a decentralized prediction market and a gambling game. In addition,  comes with payment functions and native cryptocurrency The blockchain system makes it naturally suitable for prediction markets. Finally, unlike betting based on random events (such as guessing the size), the prediction market is based on a global or public event, and the result is often based on facts, such as who the World Cup champion is. , Apple’s stock price at the end of the year, who will be the next president of the United States, all these issues are public events. Gambling against these public events can produce information that is helpful to people's decision-making, but the information generated by gambling has not much reference value.

## What do you think are the advantages of Zeitgeist?

## Comparison of Rust and Go

**The advantages of Rust are:**

- Excellent running speed
- Reduce Runtime overhead and reduce GC STW
- Excellent performance in concurrency, security and performance
- Interoperability with c and other languages
- Generic support

**The advantages of Golang:**

- Easy to learn
- Compiles much faster than Rust
- Provides concurrency directly to participants

In a word:

**Rust is a low-level statically typed multi-paradigm programming language that focuses on security and performance. Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable and efficient software. **

**Scope of application**:

- Golang is useful for writing microservices and typical "DevOps" tasks, but it is not a system programming language. 

  For tasks where concurrency, security, and/or performance are important, Rust is stronger. But its learning curve is steeper than Go.

- For large teams or projects that require rapid iteration, Go is recommended.
