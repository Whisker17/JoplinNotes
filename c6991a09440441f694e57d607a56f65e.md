## What is Prediction Market？

The prediction market is a speculative market that allows traders to establish positions on possible future outcomes. 

The prediction market is an excellent knowledge gathering mechanism that can collect various information from a large number of independent participants.

The prediction market is a wonderful thought experiment. If anyone can bet money on any event, the society will be able to make better use of the hidden information and knowledge. 

Furthermore, it can even use the prediction market to change the outcome of the event to the specific direction. 

The prediction market can also predict the future, hedge the risk of possible future events, and provide incentives for the future due to the correlation of interests. 

The relationship between the prediction market and reality is two-way. Reality can affect the market. Similarly, we can also output high-quality information for reality through the game of the market. Eventually, the prediction market can become a tool to collect world information and make better predictions. 

With individuals being financially incentivized to predict the outcome/decision most likely to find consensus among all stakeholders, solutions can reach consensus much more efficiently. This is because the fight for personal interests in a decision-making process gets balanced out by an economic self-interest of predicting a consensus-reaching alternative.

## What is Futarchy？

- "Futarchy" is an untested form of management.
In Futarchy, democracy is still expressing what we want, but the prediction market now decides how to achieve it .
- A proposed policy becomes law when the betting market clearly estimates that it will raise the expected national wealth 
- Futarchy seems likely to succeed if we accept the following three assumptions:

  - Democracy will probably fail because not enough information is collected.
- It is not so difficult to tell the difference between rich and happy countries and poor and miserable ones.
  - The betting market is the best place we know to gather information.
- The concept of Futarchy, which is a governance model based on the ability to predict the market, may further influence the way decisions and politics are executed.In Futarchy, decision makers do not vote directly on policies, but rather on desired results (or "KPIS" for managers).Forecasting markets are set up for policies that are likely to have the greatest impact on this indicator and which policies will actually be implemented.

## Advantages and possible disadvantages of Futarchy

- Management processes in today's society still rely on a flawed and arbitrary centralized approach, and Futarchy can be utilized to improve transparency and effectiveness.
- **Advantages**
  - Futarchy addresses the issues of "voting silence" and "rational irrationality" in democracy
  - Futarchy reduces potential irrational social factors in the management process.
    In Futarchy, participation in government-run processes encourages people to focus more on the proposal rather than the personality, and the main activities are non-social.
- **shortcomings**
  - Markets are easy to manipulate.
    A powerful entity or coalition government that wants to see a desired outcome can push the price down by buying "yes" tokens and selling "no" tokens short.
  - Forecast markets are zero-sum;
    Therefore, because participants must guarantee non-zero communication costs, this is not reasonable for participants.
    As a result, there will be fewer participants, so there won't be enough market depth, and there won't be enough profit for experts and analytics firms to make from the information they gather.

## What is the deference between CPM and DPM？

Compared with traditional centralized prediction markets, decentralized prediction markets relying on cryptocurrencies can be 

- **open** (usually, traditional prediction markets are limited to the countries/regions where they were created. But for cryptocurrencies , It is difficult to limit it.),
- **less restrictions** (many of today’s most popular prediction markets have restrictions. For example, if users win in many markets, they are no longer allowed to bet.) ,
- **Lower fees** (in most cases, the cost of a centralized market is higher than that of Ethereum) 
- **cannot be closed by one party** (the centralized prediction market has a history of being closed).

## What is the deference between prediction market and betting?

- Fair, open and transparent blockchain technology can ensure the fairness and justice of the prediction market, and the **handling fee is extremely low**. 
- In addition,  comes with **payment functions** and **native cryptocurrency** The blockchain system makes it naturally suitable for prediction markets. 
- Finally, unlike **betting based on random events** (such as guessing the size), the prediction market is based on a global or public event, and the result is often based on facts, such as who the World Cup champion is. , Apple’s stock price at the end of the year, who will be the next president of the United States, all these issues are public events. Gambling against these public events can produce information that is helpful to people's decision-making, but the information generated by gambling has not much reference value. 
- And in PM, there exists shares, which is a kind of liquidity. This allows for considerably greater liquidity, given that participants need not necessarily wait until the event occurs.

## What do you think are the advantages of Zeitgeist?

- Support two different schemes of binary market and scalar market. AMM and order book

- Based on a prediction market made by kusama, the transaction fee is relatively low, and it is more suitable for crosschain

- Joint operation of governance system with futarchy, prediction markets can be a cornerstone in  on-chain governance mechanism by using Futarchy.

  


## Why PM haven't picked up huge adoption？

- scalability and usability reasons

## Difference between other PM?

- Gnosis is oracle-agnostic and allows market-creators to choose their own oracles (centralized or decentralized) using a oracle platform.
- In other words, Augur develops governance mechanisms in order to create decentralized oracles that verify events. Augur use 0x protocol 's off-chain order book scheme to solve lacking of liquidity.
- Polkamarkets is not building a parachain, but rather a single application being deployed to a parachain. Zeitgeist could potentially support thousands of polkamarket-like applications on its base layer parachain. Being a parachain allows Zeitgeist to have robust and adaptable governance and evolvability controlled by the ZTG holders.

## Comparison of Rust and Go

**The advantages of Rust are:**

- Excellent running speed
- Reduce Runtime overhead and reduce GC STW
- Excellent performance in concurrency, security and performance
- Interoperability with c and other languages
- Generic support

**The advantages of Golang:**

- Easy to learn
- Compiles much faster than Rust
- Provides concurrency directly to participants

In a word:

**Rust is a low-level statically typed multi-paradigm programming language that focuses on security and performance. Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable and efficient software. **

**Scope of application**:

- Golang is useful for writing microservices and typical "DevOps" tasks, but it is not a system programming language. 

  For tasks where concurrency, security, and/or performance are important, Rust is stronger. But its learning curve is steeper than Go.

- For large teams or projects that require rapid iteration, Go is recommended.
