## What is Prediction Market？

A prediction market is a speculative market that allows traders to take a position on possible future outcomes.
Prediction markets are a beautiful thought experiment. If anyone can bet money on any event, society can make better use of the hidden information and knowledge. Furthermore, it can even use prediction markets to direct the outcome of events .
Forecasting market can also predict the future, hedge the risk of possible future events and stimulate the future due to the possible correlation of interests.
The relationship between the prediction market and the reality is two-way. The reality can affect the market, and we can also output high-quality information for the reality through the game of the market. Finally, the prediction market can become a tool to collect world information and make better predictions.

If anyone can use money to bet on predictions for any event, the ** society will be able to make better use of the hidden information and knowledge, and even further, it can even use the prediction market to target Change the outcome of the event**. The prediction market can also predict the future, hedge the risks of things that may happen in the future, and provide incentives for the future due to the correlation of interests. The relationship between the prediction market and reality is two-way. Reality can affect the market. Similarly, we can also output high-quality information for reality through the game of the market. Eventually, the prediction market can become a tool to collect world information and make better predictions. .



## What is the deference between CPM and DPM？

Decentralized prediction markets based on cryptocurrencies can be more open than traditional centralized prediction markets, which are usually limited to the country that created them.
But when it comes to cryptocurrencies, it's hard to limit it.)
Many of today's most popular forecasting markets have limitations.
For example, users are no longer allowed to bet if they win in many markets.)
, ** lower costs ** (in most cases, centralized markets have higher costs than Ethereum) and ** can't be shut down by a party ** (centralized prediction markets have a history of being shut down).



Compared with traditional centralized prediction markets, decentralized prediction markets relying on cryptocurrencies can be **open** (usually, traditional prediction markets are limited to the countries/regions where they were created. But for cryptocurrencies , It is difficult to limit it.), **less restrictions** (many of today’s most popular prediction markets have restrictions. For example, if users win in many markets, they are no longer allowed to bet.) , **Lower fees** (in most cases, the cost of a centralized market is higher than that of Ethereum) and **cannot be closed by one party** (the centralized prediction market has a history of being closed).

## What is the deference between prediction market and betting?

Fair, open and transparent blockchain technology can ensure the fairness and justice of the prediction market, and the handling fee is extremely low. This is the difference between a decentralized prediction market and a gambling game. In addition,  comes with payment functions and native cryptocurrency The blockchain system makes it naturally suitable for prediction markets. Finally, unlike betting based on random events (such as guessing the size), the prediction market is based on a global or public event, and the result is often based on facts, such as who the World Cup champion is. , Apple’s stock price at the end of the year, who will be the next president of the United States, all these issues are public events. Gambling against these public events can produce information that is helpful to people's decision-making, but the information generated by gambling has not much reference value.

## Comparison of Rust and Go

**The advantages of Rust are:**

-Excellent running speed
-Reduce Runtime overhead and reduce GC stw
-Excellent performance in concurrency, security and performance
-Interoperability with c and other languages
-Generic support

**The advantages of Golang:**

-Easy to learn
-The compilation speed is much faster than rust
-Provides concurrency directly to participants

One sentence summary:

**Rust is a low-level statically typed multi-paradigm programming language that focuses on security and performance. Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable and efficient software. **

**Scope of application**:

-Golang is useful for writing microservices and typical "DevOps" tasks, but it is not a system programming language. For tasks where concurrency, security, and/or performance are important, Rust is stronger. But its learning curve is steeper than Go.
-For large teams or projects that require rapid iteration, Go is recommended.

In a word:

**Rust is a low-level statically typed multi-normal form programming language that focuses on security and performance.
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
